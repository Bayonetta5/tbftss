<h2>The Pandoran War</h2>

<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>

</p>
<p>Note: this game is still under heavy development and will feature bugs, incomplete sections, and a numerous other issues until it reaches v1.0. Likewise, this gameplay manually will evolve over time, to become more detailed and helpful.</p>

<h3>Title Screen</h3>
<p>
This is the first screen that you will see upon starting the game. You may select from the following options:
<ul>
<li>New Game - Start a new game (note: this will overight any game that is currently in progress)</li>
<li>Continue - Continue the current game. This will be the default option if a save file is found.</li>
<li>Options - Configure various configuration option. See the options section for more information.</li>
<li>Quit - Exit the game</li>
</ul>
</p>

<h3>Galactic Map</h3>
<p>
This is the main mission select screen. Here, you can move around and select star systems in which to undertake missions. Star Systems that have missions will emit red circles at regular intervals. Yellow circles will be emitted by star systems that have no active missions, but still have challenges that can be attempted. Green circles will emit from system that have missions and changes that are 100% completed. You may replay any of these missions, at any time.

<h3>Star Systems</h3>
<p>
The Star System view shows a list of missions available for that star system. Missions must be played sequentially, with the next available mission being highlighted in yellow.

<h3>Missions</h3>
<p>
Each mission has various objectives that the player must finish in order to complete the mission successfully. The mission ends when the player either successfully completes all the objectives, or is killed. Note: there is no friendly fire between those on the same side (in other words, you need not worry about firing upon your team mates, or them hitting you - no damage will be taken).
