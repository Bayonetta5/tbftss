<h1>The Battle for the Solar System</h1>
<h2>The Pandoran War</h2>

<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>
The Battle for the Solar System - The Pandoran War is a 2D space shooter, based on the space opera novels by Stephen J Sweeney.
</p>
<p>Note: this game is still under heavy development and will feature bugs, incomplete sections, and a numerous other issues until it reaches v1.0. Likewise, this gameplay manually will evolve over time, to become more detailed and helpful.</p>

<h3>Galactic Map</h3>
<p>
This is the main mission select screen. Here, you can move around and select star systems in which to undertake missions. Star Systems that have missions will emit red circles at regular intervals. Yellow circles will be emitted by star systems that have no active missions, but still have challenges that can be attempted.
</p>

<p>Controls</p>
<table style="border:1px solid #000; width:20em;">
<tr><td>Arrow keys</td><td>Scroll galactic map</td></tr>
<tr><td>Return</td><td>Select Star System</td></tr>
<tr><td>Escape</td><td>Menu</td></tr>
</table>

<h3>Star Systems</h3>
<p>
The Star System view shows a list of missions available for that star system. Missions must be played sequentially, with the next available mission being highlighted in yellow. The right-hand side of the star system view displays an overview of the mission, including the class of craft the player will be piloting, and the name of the pilot and their squadron.

<h3>Missions</h3>
<p>
Each mission has various objectives that the player must finish in order to complete the mission successfully. The mission ends when the player either successfully completes all the objectives, or is killed. Note: there is no friendly fire between those on the same side (in other words, you need not worry about firing upon your team mates, or them hitting you - no damage will be taken).
