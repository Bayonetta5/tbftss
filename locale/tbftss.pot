msgid "With the Pandorans having invaded Independent systems boardering the Mitikas Empire, we need to become more vigilant. Patrols around Torelli are being stepped up. Ensure you hit all the waypoints, and report any unusual activity that you encounter."
msgstr ""

msgid "Anyone got anything to report?"
msgstr ""

msgid "You getting paranoid, Curtis?"
msgstr ""

msgid "You all saw what happened at Coyote."
msgstr ""

msgid "So, those Pandorans are, what, robots?"
msgstr ""

msgid "Alien-Human hybrid, I heard."
msgstr ""

msgid "Hard to kill, whatever they are. Heard they'll still be coming at you even if you take both arms off."
msgstr ""

msgid "And what'll they do then? Bite you to death?"
msgstr ""

msgid "Eyes open, lads."
msgstr ""

msgid "We're done. Anyone detect anything unusual?"
msgstr ""

msgid "Same old, same old."
msgstr ""

msgid "Believe me, that's a good thing. Right, let's head home and report in."
msgstr ""

msgid "Patrols so far have not uncovered anything unusual, and it seems as though the increase in military presense is reducing the amount of illegal activity in this sector, with reported incidents down 80%. Still, we cannot afford to become complacent, and must continue with our sweeps."
msgstr ""

msgid "Eightballers, you have hostiles incoming. Identified as 3 Mitikas fighters; Jackals, possibly Pandoran. Engage, but exercise extreme caution."
msgstr ""

msgid "Control, enemies have been dispatched. Wasn't a comfortable fight."
msgstr ""

msgid "Eightballers, return home immediately, and deliver a full report. Do not leave out a single detail."
msgstr ""

msgid "Got it. See you soon."
msgstr ""

msgid "Following the devastating loss of the Iliad system, we need to continue to be vigilant against incursion into the Alba system. Check all five waypoints, and report immediate any unusual or suspicious activity you encounter."
msgstr ""

msgid "So, Iliad has fallen?"
msgstr ""

msgid "From what I've heard."
msgstr ""

msgid "Did they retreat, or ..."
msgstr ""

msgid "They fought to the very last."
msgstr ""

msgid "So that's it. The Pandorans have won?"
msgstr ""

msgid "At Iliad, yes. Unless the local forces there can somehow hold off the enemy's ground assault."
msgstr ""

msgid "It's ... possible, right?"
msgstr ""

msgid "The Pandorans will just nuke the place when they're done. They'll take what they need, kill everyone who stands in their way ..."
msgstr ""

msgid "And even those who don't."
msgstr ""

msgid "...and move on."
msgstr ""

msgid "You're quiet, Wade."
msgstr ""

msgid "Just thinking."
msgstr ""

msgid "What about?"
msgstr ""

msgid "How long it'll be before the Pandorans show up here."
msgstr ""

msgid "They came by earlier, in case you don't remember."
msgstr ""

msgid "And haven't been back since. Maybe we scared them off."
msgstr ""

msgid "I doubt it, guys. They were probably just scouting."
msgstr ""

msgid "Where the hell are the CSN? Why weren't they at Iliad?"
msgstr ""

msgid "They weren't wanted, apparently. Iliad and the UNF aren't getting along so well at the moment."
msgstr ""

msgid "Something to do with Adrian Parsons?"
msgstr ""

msgid "That bloody idiot? It wouldn't surprise me. He's the reason we're now in this mess! If I ever meet that guy, nothing'll stop me from-"
msgstr ""

msgid "Hey, mind what you say. All these communications are logged."
msgstr ""

msgid "(indecipherable muttering)"
msgstr ""

msgid "What do you mean, it's all Parsons' fault?"
msgstr ""

msgid "He made an executive decision over in Coyote several months ago, that screwed everything up. Something about being charged with a super weapon."
msgstr ""

msgid "Grendel's Mother?"
msgstr ""

msgid "No, something it was carrying. Linked to the ATAFs, apparently."
msgstr ""

msgid "The CSN built something that nuked a whole load of allied and Pandoran forces. It wasn't meant to be used in Coyote, though."
msgstr ""

msgid "You don't say."
msgstr ""

msgid "Okay, lads, let's wrap this topic up, eh?"
msgstr ""

msgid "That's it, all done. Anyone got anything to report?"
msgstr ""

msgid "Nothing."
msgstr ""

msgid "Nope."
msgstr ""

msgid "Okay, let's get home and report in."
msgstr ""

msgid "A number of key Independent systems have come under simultaneous attack by Tzac forces. We need to drive them away, so that we can continue to focus on the more pressing threat of the Pandoran army. At this time, it is vital that we prevent Christabel from making any significant gains by amassing her forces in these locations."
msgstr ""

msgid "Enemies sighted."
msgstr ""

msgid "Break and attack, people!"
msgstr ""

msgid "That's the first group handled. Let's get to the next waypoint."
msgstr ""

msgid "Second group located."
msgstr ""

msgid "Control, this is Rice. Nine enemy fighters downed. Moving to the final waypoint."
msgstr ""

msgid "Final group spotted."
msgstr ""

msgid "That's all of them."
msgstr ""

msgid "Not as tough as I was expecting."
msgstr ""

msgid "I think they're testing the water, like our Pandoran friends before them."
msgstr ""

msgid "We'd better prepare ourselves for a major attack in the next few days. Hopefully not from both of them at once."
msgstr ""

msgid "Break and attack, lads. Let's send these guys back home."
msgstr ""

msgid "More Tzac fighters incoming."
msgstr ""

msgid "Steel yourself, lads. Even more Tzac forces are heading our way."
msgstr ""

msgid "Picking up two capital ships, moving in."
msgstr ""

msgid "Wait, those aren't only Tzac forces ... "
msgstr ""

msgid "Ah, hell! Now we've got Pandorans, too?!"
msgstr ""

msgid "Commander, we're getting shot to ribbons here! We need to fallback!"
msgstr ""

msgid "We can't let EITHER of these two win! That would be a major loss for all of us."
msgstr ""

msgid "Eightballers, de Winter of the White Knights, here to assist."
msgstr ""

msgid "White Knights! Am I glad to see you. Your timing couldn't be better."
msgstr ""

msgid "I owe you my life, Knights."
msgstr ""

msgid "We're all in this together, Rice. I'm sorry we arrived too late to save your wingmates."
msgstr ""

msgid "They were good guys. They'll be missed."
msgstr ""

msgid "We're needed elsewhere. We'll see you soon."
msgstr ""

msgid "Tzac fighers are moving in on the jumpgate. We need to stop them before they do any serious damage to it."
msgstr ""

msgid "Goddard, command of this operation will fall to you, if events lead to me being unable to participate fully."
msgstr ""

msgid "Picking up a second group of fighters, incoming."
msgstr ""

msgid "More fighters, inbound!"
msgstr ""

msgid "The jumpgate is taking damage!"
msgstr ""

msgid "Half the jumpgate's control nodes have been destroyed! We need to step up our efforts to defend it!"
msgstr ""

msgid "With the mercenary threat seen off and Tzac's initial attacks thwarted, it's time to begin pushing back against Christabel's forces. We plan to capture a number of their commanders, to help build a better picture of the forces at Mace, before moving into the system. As always, mag the targets and do not allow them to be killed."
msgstr ""

msgid "Tzac fighters spotted, both commanders are here. Goddard, disable those fighters as soon as you can."
msgstr ""

msgid "Squadron commanders disabled."
msgstr ""

msgid "Great work, everyone. We just need to wait for the tugs to arrive and bring these guys in."
msgstr ""

msgid "Commander, I'm reading incoming fighter signature: Darts."
msgstr ""

msgid "I'll bet my house those are mercenaries, and given that the relationship with Tzac didn't end amicably they're probably targetting the commanders. We can't afford to lose them."
msgstr ""

msgid "All Darts have been dispatched, Commander."
msgstr ""

msgid "Good. Not often we end up having to protect the enemy from another."
msgstr ""

msgid "Tugs are on the way. Should be here in the next few minutes"
msgstr ""

msgid "People, divide yourselves between the fighters and the Sharpfinger."
msgstr ""

msgid "We couldn't spare any bombers, so we just need to get in there and take them all on."
msgstr ""

msgid "We've received word from CSN Florin that they have suffered a power failure, affecting the entire ship. The stranded vessel has attracted the attention of the Pandorans, who have already deployed shuttles and tugs to absorb it into their ranks. The Salty Wildcats will intercept and provide cover until Florin can affect repairs."
msgstr ""

msgid "Florin, this is Black of the Salty Wildcats, here to assist."
msgstr ""

msgid "Glad to see you, Wildcats. The Pandorans arrived shortly before you did. We've got tugs and shuttles incoming."
msgstr ""

msgid "Acknowledged, we'll secure the area while you get things up and running."
msgstr ""

msgid "Florin, Pandoran vessels have been dealt with."
msgstr ""

msgid "Many thanks, Wildcats. We've identified the cause of the power outage. Should be no more than a few minutes before we can restart all systems."
msgstr ""

msgid "Wildcats, we're picking up an incoming squadron."
msgstr ""

msgid "More Pandoran tugs?"
msgstr ""

msgid "Negative. These appear to be non-aligned forces, fighters and bombers."
msgstr ""

msgid "Incoming forces are on intercept vectors. We only need a few more minutes."
msgstr ""

msgid "On it."
msgstr ""

msgid "Looks like that's all of them."
msgstr ""

msgid "Those were Kingdom of Tzac fighters. We've heard reports of them being active in some Confederation systems."
msgstr ""

msgid "Would appear that Christabel is finally ready to make good on all her threats. Great, so now we have both her AND the Pandorans to deal with."
msgstr ""

msgid "It never rains ..."
msgstr ""

msgid "We're starting systems up again. Once we've completed pre-jump checks we're heading for Temper. Thank you for your assistance."
msgstr ""

msgid "We'll meet you there."
msgstr ""

msgid "Tzac bombers have been identified in the area, deploying mines. While this violates intergalactic treaties, we could never assume that Tzac, much like the Pandorans, would abide by the rules of war. We need to take down those bombers quickly. Exercise caution around the mines, as they are especially potent."
msgstr ""

msgid "Watch out for those mines. They're on proximity triggers and have a large area of effect."
msgstr ""

msgid "Take them out from a distance, otherwise you'll be in trouble."
msgstr ""

msgid "That's the bombers taken care of, but the area is still littered with mines."
msgstr ""

msgid "We'll need to get a team in here to take care of them."
msgstr ""

msgid "Following the elimination of the Tzac bombers, we need to clear the leftover mines from the system, in case they cause us difficulties in later operations. As always, the mines should be taken down from a distance, to minimise the chances of damage being caused to your fighter during their destruction."
msgstr ""

msgid "Reyes, proceed with caution. Those mines are equipped with radar damping fields, that will prevent them from showing up at anything but close range."
msgstr ""

msgid "Remember to take them out from a distance; your TAF won't be able to withstand much impact damage from the explosions."
msgstr ""

msgid "Reyes, we're detecting incoming fighter signatures. Looks like Darts, possibly pirates. Eliminate as necessary."
msgstr ""

msgid "Control, I've dealt with both the mines and the Darts. Any idea who those guys were?"
msgstr ""

msgid "A report is being generated right now. Should be ready by the time you return."
msgstr ""

msgid "I noticed that none of those Darts tripped any mines. Maybe those were Tzac fighters?"
msgstr ""

msgid "Tzac have never been known to deploy Darts, but that was an important observation. Provide us with as many details as possible during debriefing."
msgstr ""

msgid "Remember, guys: mags only against the fighters. We're not here to take any more lives."
msgstr ""

msgid "For the corvettes, concentrate fire on the engines and the guns. Once it's out of the game, move onto the next one."
msgstr ""

msgid "Got it."
msgstr ""

msgid "We should lure the fighters away from the capital ships. Stray fire against a disabled ship could destroy it."
msgstr ""

msgid "Good point, Chaz, we should be mindful of friendly-fire."
msgstr ""

msgid "Brings back memories, doesn't it?"
msgstr ""

msgid "So long as we don't end up back in Phylent after this."
msgstr ""

msgid "This going in your journal, Kelly?"
msgstr ""

msgid "Everything. It could be important one day."
msgstr ""

msgid "Have fun with the names of Tzac's cap ships."
msgstr ""

msgid "I'll just refer to the battle logs. Military records tend to be accurate."
msgstr ""

msgid "Most of the time."
msgstr ""

msgid "All fighters disabled."
msgstr ""

msgid "Corvettes are all out of the game."
msgstr ""

msgid "Griffin, this is de Winter. Opposing forces are no longer a threat."
msgstr ""

msgid "Any casualties?"
msgstr ""

msgid "No. All fighters and caps have been shutdown, and ready for pickup."
msgstr ""

msgid "Great work, Knights. Clean up will commence shortly. Standby for new instructions."
msgstr ""

msgid "The day that we have feared and the events that we attempted to avert are now upon us - the Pandoran army has commenced its push beyond Mitikas space, and is beginning to assault neighbouring Independent star systems. We need to fight back, in order to protect Clarke from becoming underrun by this menace. Take heed: this will not be an easy battle, but we have little choice and must secure victory here today."
msgstr ""

msgid "We have successfully punched our way through several squadrons of Pandoran fighters, but their capital ships are fast approaching Dublin. Your objective is to take down two of their corvettes: INF Dirk and INF Blackjack. Ensure the Khepri-class bombers can get in close enough to delivery a strike."
msgstr ""

msgid "Commander, enemy reinforcements are enroute. Looks like more INF fighters."
msgstr ""

msgid "Dammit! Let's make sure we down the Dirk before any more turn up."
msgstr ""

msgid "INF Dirk has been downed."
msgstr ""

msgid "This is Carlyle. Enemy corvette has been destroyed. All other fighters scratched."
msgstr ""

msgid "That's good work, Commander. We're preparing to engage more enemies, so we can't put our feet up just yet."
msgstr ""

msgid "Hell. Okay, we'll return momentarily. Carlyle out."
msgstr ""

msgid "We need continue taking down the enemy's captial ships, digging in, and holding the line here. More of our own cap ships are heading up the field to meet the Pandorans head on. UNF Cleopatra is moving to intecept more enemy corvettes. Your orders are to assist it in achieving its goals."
msgstr ""

msgid "INF Khopesh is down."
msgstr ""

msgid "INF Blackjack has been destroyed."
msgstr ""

msgid "INF Asi has been destroyed."
msgstr ""

msgid "This is Carlyle. Enemy targets have been eliminated. Cleopatra still in one piece."
msgstr ""

msgid "Acknowledged. Fall back to the main fleet and await new instructions."
msgstr ""

msgid "This is going to be a long day, eh?"
msgstr ""

msgid "Maybe not, if we continue to lose ground the way we are already ..."
msgstr ""

msgid "White Knights, Commodore Parks has identified three enemy corvettes are high level targets. He wants Dodds, Koonan and Todd to take them down, as quickly as possible. There won't be any additional fighter support, but three ATAFs should be more than enough to get the job done. de Winter and Taylor are currently on another assignment. Dodds will lead the attack."
msgstr ""

msgid "Targets sighted: three capital ships, five escorts apiece."
msgstr ""

msgid "You know what to do, guys. Let's take them down."
msgstr ""

msgid "Want to take bets on how soon before they run?"
msgstr ""

msgid "Wouldn't call that a fair bet, mate. We all know they won't."
msgstr ""

msgid "More fighters inbound."
msgstr ""

msgid "Picking up another Pandoran squadron, incoming."
msgstr ""

msgid "See? That's why I didn't make a bet with you!"
msgstr ""

msgid "All capital ships down. That's, what, fifty of these things we've scratched, alone?"
msgstr ""

msgid "Seriously, I've lost count."
msgstr ""

msgid "How many more can the Pandorans have?"
msgstr ""

msgid "Only way we'll find out is if we go to Kethlan, and I'm not keen on heading there anytime soon."
msgstr ""

msgid "Chaz, anything?"
msgstr ""

msgid "Negative."
msgstr ""

msgid "Okay, let's get back to Leviathan, and wait for Kelly and Estelle to rejoin us."
msgstr ""

msgid "We have discovered that Alysha's Calling, one of the highest profile enemy frigates, is currently in the system. We are preparing a strike team of Hammerheads, led by the Twilight Lancers, to engage and destroy it. It is unknown what effects, if any, the destruction of this ship will have on enemy morale, however it can only have a positive infact on ours. The frigate's support groups will need to be destroyed first."
msgstr ""

msgid "First squadron sighted. Moving to intercept."
msgstr ""

msgid "First squadron taken down, preparing to engage second."
msgstr ""

msgid "Second squadron down. Moving up the field to engage Alysha's Calling."
msgstr ""

msgid "Welch, we are tracking a large number of fast-moving heading your way. IDs don't match anything we currently have on record."
msgstr ""

msgid "Missiles?"
msgstr ""

msgid "Too large. We'll relay more information as we get it. Be prepared to engage."
msgstr ""

msgid "Whatever these things are, they're not hard to dispatch."
msgstr ""

msgid "No, but there's a lot of them ..."
msgstr ""

msgid "Welch, we're detecting more of the swarmer things heading your way."
msgstr ""

msgid "How many more?"
msgstr ""

msgid "Tracking around three dozen, and the numbers are rising."
msgstr ""

msgid "Thunderbird, this is Welch. Swarmers have been taken care of."
msgstr ""

msgid "Good to hear, Commander. We're pulling you out there, to assist the other squadrons."
msgstr ""

msgid "What about Alysha?"
msgstr ""

msgid "The target is no longer a priority. Clarke's frontline is collapsing. They need reinforcement, ASAP."
msgstr ""

msgid "Understood. Heading there now."
msgstr ""

msgid "The enemy are beginning to overrun our frontline. Your objective is simple: engage and destroy all hostile forces. We cannot afford to lose any more ground here. To do so would mean conceding defeat and Clarke falling to the Pandoran fleet. This must not happen."
msgstr ""

msgid "The Twilight Lancers are on their way."
msgstr ""

msgid "Eight whole extra fighters? We might outnumber the enemy, but they still outgun us!"
msgstr ""

msgid "At this point, any additional support is welcome. And we still have the support of Cleopatra and Artemis."
msgstr ""

msgid "Welch here, engaging targets."
msgstr ""

msgid "Not a moment too soon, Commander."
msgstr ""

msgid "We're wearing them down. Keep up the pressure."
msgstr ""

msgid "Think they're pull back if we hit them hard enough?"
msgstr ""

msgid "Too early to speculate. Just concentrate on taking down their fighters."
msgstr ""

msgid "I've just been tailed by something I've never seen before! Small, highly maneuverable, rapid fire particle cannon."
msgstr ""

msgid "Swarmers! The enemy have deployed them here, too!"
msgstr ""

msgid "How many?"
msgstr ""

msgid "Tracking a dozen, but the numbers are growing rapidly"
msgstr ""

msgid "I've lost count how many of these damn swarmers I've taken down."
msgstr ""

msgid "It's like fighting a hydra! You cut off one head, and two more spring up!"
msgstr ""

msgid "There's too many of them!"
msgstr ""

msgid "Keep fighting, we can still win this!"
msgstr ""

We need to continue to smash the rings as we find them and prevent them from gaining a foothold in Temper, as this could only be bad for morale and the war effort.

We have identified a number of Darts massing for what appears to be a strike against CSN assets, in retribution. We're not going to give the pirates the chance to do so, and strike them first. Strickland will lead the Steel Bulls into battle."

msgstr ""

msgid "Whatever the number, we'll make sure we send a clear message it wasn't enough!"

Civilian losses should be minimised."
